# Ryan Tang Portfolio

A modern, interactive portfolio site built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Three.js, Framer Motion, Lottie, and Vanta.js. Inspired by salcosta.dev and ryantang.site, with a focus on digital marketing, creative direction, and web development.

## Features
- **Modal-Driven Navigation:** All main sections (About, Design, Development, Retail & Ecommerce) open as animated modals, with direct route support (e.g. `/about`, `/design`).
- **3D Animated Hero:** Interactive morphing orb (About Me), Vanta.js animated background (RINGS), and bold, modern-retro typography.
- **Design Gallery:** Responsive, scrollable masonry gallery with image enlargement modal, using assets from `public/DesignAssets`.
- **Development & Retail Modals:** Dedicated modals for Development (with project links/screenshots) and Retail & Ecommerce (with client/personal links).
- **Games & Demos:** Playable browser-based Pong and Tetris games, with a floating circular Tetris button for instant access.
- **Minimalist Navigation:** Sticky header with minimalist hamburger menu (Email Me, Resume download).
- **Section Reveal Animations:** Uses Intersection Observer and Framer Motion for smooth section transitions.
- **Mobile Responsive:** Fully responsive, touch-friendly design.
